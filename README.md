## Technologies

* Ruby on Rails 4.2
* Ruby 2.2
* Postgres

## Live demo

Deploy app to Heroku using button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

You will be prompted to provide Heroku with following  credentials:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Slack token (optional)
* Slack enabling (optional)

## Authorisation

Our application authenticates users with Google via OAuth. You must have your
own Google project, which you can create
[here](https://console.developers.google.com/project). You can check your Client
ID and Client Secret under `Credentials` in console.

Remember to add Redirect URI for your Heroku application - it should look
similar to this:

`http://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/auth/google_oauth2/callback`

## Slack

Application can be synchronised with Slack to send notifications and fetch
channels. You can find your Slack Token
[here](https://api.slack.com/web).

## Setup

Run the following command:

```
bin/setup
```

## Development

### Guard

Keep guard running at all times:

```
bin/guard
```

### Code Style

Please follow Ruby style guide available [here](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

Use `bin/guard` to have your development process be watched by an automated tool
which checks your tests and code syntax. If you have any issues about the
feedback provided by `rubocop`, please consult it with dev team and apply
changes to `.rubocop.yml` file.

## Tests

We use RSpec 3.
